# DFLSLAM

Deep Feature based Life-long SLAM

This is a naive engineering work combining deep features with a conventional key-points based visual-SLAM framework ([ORB_SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2) to be specific) for my SRTP (Student Research Training Program) as an undergraduate student. Do not expect superior performances over existing methods or real-time capabilities.

The project is still under construction for easier deployment.
